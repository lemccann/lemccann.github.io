_Fall 2024; Spring 2025_

This class introduces students to the study of public administration and policy. We compare competing perspectives of governance (political, legal, and managerial) and identify the operational challenges they present. We examine the actors, structures, functions, processes, and outcomes of government and governance. The range of topics includes the history of public administration; government structure and reform; theories of the policy process; organizational management; people in government; public budgeting and finance; and social accountability and ethics. Throughout the class, we will emphasize the interdisciplinary characteristics of public administration and policy studies and encourage the exploration of creative solutions to public problems.
