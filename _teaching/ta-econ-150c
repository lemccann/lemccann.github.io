This course describes the operational fundamentals of the global food system ranging from smaller-scale subsistence or organic production to the larger-scale commercial food trade.  Consumer food behavior, both local and international, represents a core analytical issue in this class.  A consistent thread throughout the course is the evaluation of the role of markets to efficiently and effectively allocate food resources for individuals and societies.
