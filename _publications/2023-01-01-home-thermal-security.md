excerpt: "This article contributes to theoretical understandings of the relationships among extreme heat vulnerability, energy equity and home thermal security (HTS) – the ability to maintain a home thermal environment consistent with basic health, social and financial needs. Based on three years of mixed-methods qualitative research among social service practitioners, landlords and residents of mobile and manufactured housing (MH) communities, we argue that thermal insecurity is a socially produced, rather than intrinsic, feature of MH. We use the thermal struggles of MH residents to illustrate how gaps in research, markets, landlord-tenant law, policy, and specific government programs overlap to produce MH as a site of hyper-exclusion from many tools used to mitigate and adapt to climate risk. We find that most MH residents, despite barriers and a warming climate, are able to maintain some level of HTS. We highlight the small-scale, improvisational strategies that households use to cope and adapt to the extreme temperatures. HTS is an achievement sustained by a variety of elements that cannot be reduced to simple metrics (e.g., presence of air conditioning). We conclude with a practical set of policy recommendations as well as a call for an expansive “climate finance” that includes the improvisational practices of excluded groups as innovations worth learning from and investing in."
