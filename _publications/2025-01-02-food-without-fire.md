excerpt: "Over 80% of the population in rural Sub-Saharan Africa relies on biomass cooking fuel,
a significant contributor to anthropogenic greenhouse gases. We use a field experiment
in Zambia to investigate the impact of solar stoves on biomass fuel use and cooking
habits. Participants kept detailed food diaries, recording every ingredient and fuel
source used in preparing every dish in every meal every day during the experiment. This
produces data on 93,000 ingredients used to prepare 30,000 dishes. Treated households
significantly reduce biomass fuel use, cutting emissions by 3-7%, but do not significantly
change cooking habits."
