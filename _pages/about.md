I am a PhD candidate in the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona. My research blends theories of public policy and administration with elements from economics and economic geography to assess social equity in housing policy design and implementation.

I hold bachelor’s degrees in Environmental Science and Russian from the University of Florida and master’s degrees in Development Practice and Applied Economics and Policy Analysis from the University of Arizona.
